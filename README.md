Construct your own spell book from the magical pages scattered around the world! 

It's made as an entry to Modfest 1.21, although not particularly on theme, which is "Time, Technology & Throwbacks". It may not look like one to you, bit it *is* a throwback - a throwback to Modfest 1.17, when I had the idea for book centered magic mod, yet had abandoned it.

I didn't see how it all could fit together to make a fun experience, but now (= three years later), halfway through the current modfest, the idea finished cooking in my head, and I felt like working on it. So, let's cast some spells!

## Overview

The mod is centered on using spell books, which double as a container for the spell pages and as an actual book you can read and use to cast the spells within. 

**Spell Pages** are found in the world, currently as loot in dungeons, desert and jungle temples and strongholds.

They can be inserted into a spell book in the **Arcane Table**, alongside some utilities like **Bookmarks**.

Then, use the spell book to read about the spell, fill ingredients and comply with the requirements, if any, and hold the chant button!

A number of spells require **Arcane Glyphs** to be placed on the ground, which will define the area of effect of the spell. 
Simply right click with Lapis Lazuli on the ground to place them.

Woila! You've cast a spell!
